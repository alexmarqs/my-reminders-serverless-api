# My reminders using Vercel API serverless functions ‚è∞ üöÄ

This repository contains some serverless functions that I'm using to periodically remind me about personal stuff. I'm deploying these functions with the cloud platform Vercel.

Current API endpoints:

- `api/reminder`: Read expenses from my **private google sheet** and send a list by **sms (twilio)** to my phone number;

## Scheduled/cron job to call my API endpoints

There are multiple options for this. I can create my own scheduler job system, use one of the existing online cron services (easycron, cron-job.org, etc.) or use the main cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) that also have cron services available. However, in this case I'm using the **Github Actions** to create a scheduled job to invoke my API, check `.github/workflows/reminders-cron-job.yml` for more details.

## Prerequisites

Install Vercel globally to be able to run the project and deploy it later.

```
npm install -g vercel
```

The required environemnt variables (see `.env.example`) must be configured.

## Deployment

To replicate the Vercel deployment environment locally without requiring a deploy each time a change is made, execute:

```
vercel dev
```

To test the cron jobs against the API serverless functions during the development I can use the [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) in order to expose them to the world through my local machine.

To create a deployment for a production environemnt, execute:

```
vercel --prod
```
